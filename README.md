Final code used the protocol submission to Wellcome Open Research titled "'Mapping global research on climate and health using machine learning (a systematic protocol)"

The script contains both the code for machine learning (active_learning_with_evaluation.ipynb), making use of SciKit Learn, and for the creating the plots of the results, which are used to further analyse the results. Some of these plots are used in subsequent publications.

The project makes used of the NACSOS platform (https://zenodo.org/record/4121526) to retreive the documents.
